# Roadmap
I created this roadmap to organize the learning of machine learning and related math.

# In progress
- [X] 1. Fundamental  
    statistics and probability: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability  
    **basic of computer science:** https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles  
    
- [X] 2. An Introduction to Statistical Learning
    - video: https://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/
    - book: https://www.statlearning.com/  
      1. **Finish exercises in python, see below for other's solution as reference.**
      2. **Write down concepts in Concepts.md**
    - code reference:   
      https://github.com/tdpetrou/Machine-Learning-Books-With-Python  
      https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python  
      https://botlnec.github.io/islp/  
      https://github.com/qx0731/Sharing_ISL_python  
      
- [X] 2.1 Jupyter and Panda
  - start jupyter by: 
    > jupyter lab
  - Panda is R's equivalent in Python  
    1. **know how to load, filter, visualize and analyze data**  
        https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html  
        https://matplotlib.org/3.5.0/gallery/pyplots/boxplot_demo_pyplot.html
